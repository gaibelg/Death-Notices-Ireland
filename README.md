# Death-Notices-Ireland
A simple scraper for death notices in Ireland. Written to assist Karlinsky A. and Kobak D. with their paper: ["The World Mortality Dataset: Tracking excess mortality across countries during the COVID-19 pandemic"](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.27.21250604v1). The scraper automatically retrieves data up until January 2021. 

* Open the notebook in Google Colab, run the script and the data will download automatically.
